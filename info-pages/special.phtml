Between May and December 2019, the Catalogue of Life migrated in a new software environment developed by CoL+ GBIF project with the participation of Olaf Banki as a PI, Markus DÃ¶ring and Ayco Holleman as back-end developers, and Thomas Jeppesen as a front-end developer.
</p>
<p>
We are presenting a first pilot release of the CoL database which was generated in a new environment. It includes data from 166 GSDs almost identical to the 2019 Annual Checklist. Four regional and thematic checklists, which temporarily filled taxonomic gaps in the CoL, have been removed from the global checklist: ITIS Regional, Catalogue of Life China, New Zealand Inventory of Biodiversity and some taxa from The Paleobiology Database. These checklists will appear in a regional component of the CoL.
</p>
<p>
Only World Scarabaeidae Database has been updated for a new version in this pilot release.
