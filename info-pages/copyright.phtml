<p>&copy; 2019, Species 2000<br />
This online database is copyrighted by Species 2000 on behalf of the
Catalogue of Life partners.</p>
<p>Use of the content (such as the classification, synonymic species checklist, and scientific names) for publications and databases by individuals and organizations for not-for-profit usage is encouraged, on condition that full and precise credit is given at three levels on all occasions that records are shown. The three-part credit includes the complete work, the contributing database of the record, and the expert who provides editorial scrutiny of the taxonomic record. For example, these might be as follows:</p>
<p>
1) <i>Species 2000 &amp; ITIS Catalogue of Life,</i> [please specify exact edition, for example, <i>25th March 2019</i> or <i>2019 Annual Checklist</i>],<br />
2) The full or short name of the contributing dataset, such as:
<em>Staphyliniformia world catalog database</em> or <em>StaphBase</em> as a short name,<br />
3) The names of author(s)/editor(s) of the contributing database, such as <em>Newton A.F.</em><br />
</p>
<p>This three-part credit can in many cases be kept brief by using a
standard form and one or more logos as in the following example:
"Species recognized by Newton A.F., Staphyliniformia world catalog database, ver. Nov 2018 in the Catalogue of Life, 2019 Annual Checklist". 
</p>
<p>If you wish to use the content on a public portal or webpage you are
required to notify <a href="mailto:sp2000@sp2000.org">Species 2000 Secretariat</a>, both to request written permission and to assist with a check that the correct credits are given.</p>
