<p>
The Catalogue of Life (CoL) is the nearest thing to a comprehensive catalogue of all known species of organisms on Earth. Continuous progress is made towards completion, and this edition contains <b><?php echo $this->stats['species']; ?> </b> species. Please note that this is probably just over 80% of the world's known species. The Catalogue of Life estimates 2.2M extant species on the planet known to taxonomists at present time. This means that for many groups it continues to be deficient, and users will notice that many species are still missing from the Catalogue.</p>
<p>The present Catalogue is compiled from checklists provided by <b><?php echo $this->stats['databases']-1; ?></b> taxonomic databases. Many of these contain taxonomic data and opinions from extensive networks
of specialists, so that the complete work contains contributions from more than
4,000 specialists distributed throughout the global taxonomic profession. Species 2000 and ITIS teams peer review databases, select appropriate sectors and integrate the sectors into a single coherent catalogue with a single
hierarchical classification.
</p>

<p>The network and e-infrastructure of the CoL was realised step-wise in a number of projects mainly with investments from the European Commission but also from other sources around the world. Unified workflow brings the Annual Checklist and Dynamic Checklist together into the Catalogue of Life. CoL Workbench tool has been used for data harvesting and final processing of the Catalogue of Life editions since September 2011.

<span class="field_header">&#8226; The Catalogue of Life <span style="font-weight: normal;">(monthly updated editions)</span></span>
<br/>
These are progressively evolving editions in what becomes a dynamically developing system, made available online with web services. 
The dynamic monthly edition is a constantly evolving version of the Catalogue of Life. Anything can change as the list develops: names, their associated details, and their content providers and there is no tracking of those changes. For that reason, the monthly edition is not the one to quote if you wish to cite a verifiable source. It is, however, a great 'expert system', helping those at the forefront of their science to track, and contribute to the development of taxonomy. Periodic issues are progressively enhanced, in what will evolve as a dynamically developing system, made available online and as web-services.
We have launched monthly editions in February 2012. The latest version is always available for online access at <a href = "http://www.catalogueoflife.org/col"  target = "_blank">www.catalogueoflife.org/col</a>. The announcement of every new release is published on CoL Twitter (<a href = "https://twitter.com/catalogueoflife"  target = "_blank">twitter.com/catalogueoflife</a>).

<span class="field_header">&#8226; Annual Checklist <span style="font-weight: normal;">of the Catalogue of Life</span></span>
<br/>
This is a fixed edition published online (with web services) and not on DVD anymore after 2018. 
The Annual Checklist is a snapshot of the entire Catalogue of Life: a fixed imprint. If you quote an organism from this version, others will be able to turn to that same reference - at any point in the future. All editions of the Annual Checklist to date are available online, and deposited in libraries around the world. Partner programmes, that link online to the Catalogue of Life, will reference the Annual Checklist.
The latest Annual Checklist is always available online at <a href = "http://www.catalogueoflife.org/annual-checklist"  target = "_blank">www.catalogueoflife.org/annual-checklist</a>.
The archive edition for 2019 is at <a href = "http://www.catalogueoflife.org/annual-checklist/2019"  target = "_blank">www.catalogueoflife.org/annual-checklist/2019</a>. Archive editions of previous years can be found by changing the year in the URL (e.g. /2018, /2017, etc.). Downloadable versions and web services are available at <a href = "http://www.catalogueoflife.org"  target = "_blank">www.catalogueoflife.org</a>.

<p class="field_header">The Catalogue of Life history</p>
<p>
In June 2001 the Species 2000 and ITIS organisations, that had previously worked separately, decided to work together to create the Catalogue of Life. The two organisations remain separate and different in structure. However, by working together in creating a common product, the partnership has enabled them to reduce duplication of effort, make better use of resources, and to accelerate production. The combined Annual Checklist has become well established as a cited reference used for data compilation and comparison. For instance, it is used as the principal taxonomic index in the GBIF and EoL data portals and recognised by the CBD.

</p>
<p class="field_header">Innovating the Catalogue of Life data infrastructure</p>
<p>
Following the Species 2000 strategic plan 2016-2020 the Catalogue of Life is innovating its data infrastructure. The current e-infrastructure no longer meets the changing requirements of the knowledge providers and the institutional users, nor the editorial office. The innovation project aims to improve the usefulness and applicability of the Catalogue of Life for global biodiversity information initiatives such as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, Encyclopedia of Life, Biodiversity Heritage Library, and Barcode of Life, and because of this promotes interoperability between these resources. Also it will address the measure of completeness of the Catalogue of Life and forge collaboration with other name documenting initiatives.
</p>

<p class="field_header">About Species 2000</p>
<p>
Species 2000 (<a href="http://www.sp2000.org" target = "_blank">www.sp2000.org</a>) is an autonomous federation of taxonomic 
database custodians, involving taxonomists throughout the world. The goal 
is to collate a uniform and validated index to the world's known species: <b>the Catalogue of Life</b>. 
Species 2000 is registered as a not-for-profit company limited by guarantee (registered in England No. 3479405) with taxonomic databases and relevant software organisations from around the world as members. Species 2000 started from a TDWG Task Group in 1996; sponsored by CODATA, IUBS and IUMS. It is an associate participant in GBIF, recognised authority by UNEP, CBD, IPBES and providing a validated taxonomic backbone to GBIF, EBI/NSDC, Barcode of Life, IUCN Red List, EoL and many other initiatives aggregating data or producing services.</p>

<p>
Species 2000 is governed by an Annual General Meeting appointed Board of Directors that deals with legal and financial matters, and that is advised by the CoL Global Team on scientific policy and information and communications technology (ICT).

<p class="field_header">About ITIS</p>
<p>
The Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS) is a partnership of federal agencies and other organisations from the United States, Canada and Mexico, with data stewards and experts from around the world (see <a href="http://www.itis.gov" target="_blank">www.itis.gov</a>). The ITIS database is an automated reference of scientific and common names of all seven kingdoms of life (Archaea, Bacteria, Protozoa, Chromista, Fungi, Plantae, Animalia) and contains global treatments for most groups. The ITIS data development team, taxonomists, and taxonomic stewards work to create, update, and expand taxonomic coverage through direct checklist development or through adoption of published revisions and checklists. Taxonomic groups are periodically reviewed and updated for currency as part of long-term ITIS planning. All groups entered into ITIS are subjected to numerous proofing, data standard, and validation criteria and are assessed for both taxonomic credibility and completeness. Currently, ITIS contains more than 930,035 scientific and common names in all kingdoms. ITIS is a founding associate member of GBIF and supplies both global and New World groups to the Catalogue of Life - with emphasis on GSDs.
</p>

<p class="field_header">Structure of the Catalogue of Life</p>
<p>The CoL goal is to list every distinct species in each group of
organisms. At present, some groups are globally complete, some are
represented by global checklists that are nearing completion, and others
are represented by partially completed checklists. The global sectors, whether complete or not, are provided by selected, peer reviewed <b>global species databases</b> (GSDs - see definition below) in the Species 2000 federation or by
equivalent global sectors of ITIS. The Catalogue of Life has expanded its coverage to include fossil taxa since 2015.

</p>
<div class="copyright_notice"><b>Definition of a Global Species Database
(GSD)</b>
<p>This is a taxonomic database, which aspires to the following properties:</p>
<p>&#8226; Cover one taxon worldwide<br />
&#8226; Contain a taxonomic checklist of all species within that taxon<br />
&#8226; Deal with species as taxa, and contain synonymy and taxonomic
opinion<br />
&#8226; Have an explicit mechanism for seeking at least one
responsible/consensus taxonomy, and for applying it consistently<br />
&#8226; Cross-index significant alternative taxonomies in their synonymy</p>
</div>

<p>The partial sectors in the Catalogue of Life are supplied by regional species databases such as ITIS Regional (North America), NZIB (New Zealand), Catalogue of Life China, Fauna Europaea, and by thematic databases such as WoRMS (marine species) and FADA (freshwater species). Sometime, regional and thematic checklists are the only currently available resources for incomplete groups. Regional and thematic checklists have been assembled in CoL proto-GSDs. A <b>proto-GSD</b> is a taxonomic database with a draft species checklist, which is built from regional, thematic and nomenclatural databases, using semi-automatic procedures for merging species lists under a single management classification, without detailed scrutiny by taxon specialists. Since 2013, the Catalogue of Life has experimented with proto-GSDs in phyla Platyhelminthes, Myxozoa, Mollusca, in class Clitellata (Annelida) and in copepod orders Calanoida and Poecilostomatoida. Each proto-GSD was a temporarily solution  until an equivalent GSD becomes available to the Catalogue of Life.</p>

<p>Each species in the Catalogue of Life is listed with an accepted scientific name, a cited reference and its position in the hierarchical classification. In addition, common names, synonyms, and distribution and ecological data are provided, but these data may not be complete. The list of field groups (known as the "Catalogue of Life Standard Dataset") is given below:</p>

<div class="copyright_notice"><b>The Catalogue of Life Standard Dataset (2014 version)</b>
<p>(1) Accepted scientific name with references<br/>
    (2) Synonyms with references<br/> 
    (3) Common names with references<br/> 
    (4) Classification above genus<br/> 
    (5) Distribution<br/> 
    (6) Life Zone/Environment<br/>
    (7) Current and Past Existence<br/>
    (8) Additional data (optional)<br/>
    (9) Latest taxonomic scrutiny (specialist name and date)<br/> 
   (10) Source database name and version<br/>
   (11) Link to online resource<br/>


</div>
<p>More detailed information about the Standard Dataset is available on
the Catalogue of Life website (<a href="http://www.catalogueoflife.org/content/contributing-your-data#standard" target="_blank">www.catalogueoflife.org</a>)</p>

<p>Each species is placed in a taxonomic classification, the extent of which depends on the scope of the GSD. Above the highest taxon in each GSD, the management classification, agreed by Species 2000 and ITIS as a practical tool to provide access to the species checklist, is attached. However, below the point of attachment the classification originates from the source databases and so may change with each update.</p>

<p>The top levels of the taxonomic hierarchy were set as the <I>CoL Management Classification</I> in 2005 and revised in 2011 and 2015. Please also read the notes "Classification, estimates & extinct taxa" at
<a href = "http://www.catalogueoflife.org/annual-checklist/2019/info/hierarchy" target = "_blank">www.catalogueoflife.org/annual-checklist/2019/info/hierarchy</a>.</p>

<p>Where available from the suppliers infraspecific taxa, such as
subspecies, varieties and forms, have also been included but this coverage is
variable between taxonomic sectors.</p>

<p>Where possible, a web link to a species page in the source database is provided at the bottom of each CoL Species Details page.</p>


<p class="field_header">Functionality of the Catalogue of Life</p>
<p>&#8226; Species (and infraspecific taxa) can be located either by
searching by name or by browsing through the hierarchical
classification.<br />
&#8226; Taxa of every rank can be searched or browsed with or without the inclusion of extinct taxa.<br />
&#8226; Search by name can be done using accepted scientific name,
synonym or common name. Automatic synonymic and common name indexing
takes the user directly to the species under its accepted name. The
search can use part names, or be restricted to complete words.<br />
&#8226; Transversing down the tree or classification uses accepted names for
the taxa.<br />
&#8226; On each Species Details page the relevant higher taxa are
listed, and provide a link to the relevant node of the hierarchical
classification.<br />
&#8226; The Species Details pages link to the source database, usually
showing further information.<br />
&#8226; A complete species list for each higher taxon in the classification can be accessed via the option Browse Taxonomic Classification.<br />
&#8226; The current number of species for each taxon in the Catalogue, the estimated number of species and completeness of the checklists can be found in the Taxonomic Tree.<br />
&#8226; Names of source databases are displayed with each taxon in the Taxonomic Tree.<br />
&#8226; The operational menu of the Catalogue now can be shown in different languages.<br />
&#8226; A standard bibliographic citation for each contributing database can be found on the <a
    href="http://www.catalogueoflife.org/annual-checklist/2019/info/cite" target="_blank">"How To Cite?"</a> page and on the Database Details pages.
